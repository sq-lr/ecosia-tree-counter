# Tally - Ecosia Tree Counter 🌳
![Tally demonstration](./images/demonstration.png)

## About
<p>
  Tally is a simple extension to bring back the Ecosia Tree Counter. We try the best to make the tree counter seems like made by Ecosia team.
</p>

## Why
<p>
  Since september of 2023, Ecosia is no longer supporting their Tree Counter. Their explanation can be found [here](https://ecosia.helpscoutdocs.com/article/505-new-search-providers).
</p>
<p>
  A lot of users didn't like the way things came to end (including me). That's why this extension exists.
</p>

## Source
<p>
  Tally is a fork from sq-lr's "Ecosia Tree Counter" extension, wich can be finded [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ecosia-tree-counter/ibhggeicdlhjfodagonccghdijkcdcbg).
